# ShellShock Live Trainer
A simple (non intrusive) trainer for [ShellShock Live](http://www.shellshocklive.com)

**The project is only for exercise purposes and should not be used for cheating.**

My main interest is not the game itself. The goal of this project was to improve my knowledge of the Rust programming language and the Windows-API.

# Usage (Windows only)

1. Execute the trainer (installation see below).
2. Start "Shellshock Live" (the trainer automatically detects a running instance of "Shellshock Live").
3. There are six hardcoded keys
    * Key 1 (save current mouse position as position 1)
    * Key 2 (save current mouse position as position 2)
    * Key 3 (calculate different angle/speed combinations to hit the target (position 2))
    * Key 4 (clear positions)
    * Key 5 (switch calculation mode)
    * Key 6 (clear console)

Example:
1. Move the mouse over your tank and press '1'.
2. Move the mouse over the enemy tank and press '2'.
3. Press '3'.
